## Engineering Practice
1. Reduce hard-coding text or numbers. Assign them as constants instead.
2. Be mindful in naming functions and properties. A good name is that people can understand easily and generic enough to avoid further changes.
3. Consistancy, from naming components, functions to logics and code styling.

## Further challenges
If you look for challenging yourself based on this task, try the following.
1. Support multiple languages.
2. Use React Context or any state management tool (Redux, Mobx) to keep the joke text and state of the modal.
